The survey reveals that social media is a **significant part of young individualsâ€™ daily lives**, particularly students aged 18â€“22. Most respondents reported using social media for **3â€“4 hours daily**, with a tendency to engage in the morning and evening hours.

While many participants claimed they are unaffected emotionally, a **considerable number** acknowledged experiencing **anxiety, comparison, and FOMO** as a result of their social media use. These emotional effects, combined with minor disruptions in sleep and self-esteem, indicate that **mental health can be impacted both directly and indirectly**.

Interestingly, while some respondents reported **positive outcomes** such as feeling **motivated or relaxed**, a large group either felt **tired, anxious**, or noticed **no change**. The mixed response on the mental health impact rating â€” with a majority giving it a neutral score of **3** â€” confirms that the effects are **subjective** and **vary by individual behavior and usage pattern**.

In conclusion, social media is neither entirely good nor bad â€” it is the **intensity, timing, and emotional mindset** during usage that determines its psychological effect. Therefore, **mindful and balanced use of social media is key** to protecting oneâ€™s mental well-being in a digitally connected world.
